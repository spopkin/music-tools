# Tuner

The tuner is a configurable application for tuning musical instruments.  While it is still currently a work in progress, it will support the creation of custom instrument profiles for arbitrary instruments, allowing the user to tune any instrument that they so desire.

## Building

As I built it in Qt Creator under Lubuntu 16.04, these steps will assume that system configuration.  

1. `# apt install qtcreator qt4-default #alternatively, you could use qt5-default, your choice.  Not sure if you also need cmake.` 
2.  Open the project in Qt Creator, and configure it for the default desktop.
3.  Open the "Build" menu and select the "Build Project 'Tuner'" menu option.

## Running
