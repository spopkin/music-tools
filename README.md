Tools for learning and using musical instruments

Are you looking to learn the bass?  Does your guitar tuner need a new battery?  Do you want to play a game that with similar gameplay to Ubisoft's RockSmith, but with a more standard form of music notation?

If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, then these tools might be for you.
